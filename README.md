# Cab Company TDD Kata
## Story
A cab company wants to implement a new system to handle fare calculations, driver assignments, and ride tracking to 
improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. The goal is to ensure that the system is reliable, easy to maintain, and 
can be extended with new features in the future. The development team will use TDD to build this system incrementally.
The code is structured overall using the Visitor Design Pattern.

### Scenarios
### 1. Fare Calculation

As a customer, I want to know the fare for my ride based on a flat rate, so I can pay the correct amount.

### 2. Driver Assignment

As a dispatcher, I want to assign an available driver to a customer, so that the customer gets picked up as quickly as possible.
Given a list of available drivers with their locations, assign the driver closest to the customerâ€™s location.

### 3. Ride History

As a customer, I want to view my ride history, so I can track my expenses and review past trips.
Provide a detailed ride history, including dates, times, and fares for each trip.
