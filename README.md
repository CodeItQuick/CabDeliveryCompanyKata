# Cab Company TDD Kata
## Story
A cab company wants to implement a new system to handle fare calculations, driver assignments, and ride tracking to 
improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. The goal is to ensure that the system is reliable, easy to maintain, and 
can be extended with new features in the future. The development team will use TDD to build this system incrementally.

### Scenarios
### Fare Calculation

As a customer, I want to know the fare for my ride based on the distance traveled and the time taken, so I can pay the correct amount.
Given a base fare, a per-mile rate, and a per-minute rate, calculate the total fare for a trip.

### Driver Assignment

As a dispatcher, I want to assign the nearest available driver to a customer, so that the customer gets picked up as quickly as possible.
Given a list of available drivers with their locations, assign the driver closest to the customer’s location.

### Ride Tracking

As a customer, I want to track my ride in real-time, so I know when my driver will arrive and how the trip is progressing.
Given the driver’s location and the destination, provide real-time updates on the driver's ETA and the trip progress.

### Payment Processing

As a customer, I want to pay for my ride securely through the app, so I don’t need to carry cash.
Implement a payment system that securely processes credit card transactions and provides a receipt.

### Ride History

As a customer, I want to view my ride history, so I can track my expenses and review past trips.
Provide a detailed ride history, including dates, times, distances, and fares for each trip.
