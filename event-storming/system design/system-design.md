### Step 4: Visualize the System Design

**Customer App** ⟷ **Dispatch System** ⟷ **Driver App** ⟷ **GPS Navigation System**
**Customer App** ⟷ **Payment Gateway** ⟷ **Accounting System**
**Driver App** ⟷ **Fleet Management System** ⟷ **HR System**
**Notification System** ⟷ **Customer App** / **Driver App**
**Database** (Central repository for all systems)

### Step 5: Create Event Flow Diagram

1. **Customer Requests Ride** ➝
2. **Dispatch System Receives Request** ➝
3. **Ride Assigned to Driver** ➝
4. **Driver Acknowledges Assignment** ➝
5. **Driver En Route to Pickup** ➝
6. **Customer Notified of Arrival** ➝
7. **Customer Picked Up** ➝
8. **Ride in Progress** ➝
9. **Driver Arrives at Destination** ➝
10. **Fare Calculated** ➝
11. **Payment Processed** ➝
12. **Ride Completed** ➝
13. **Customer Feedback Provided** ➝
14. **Daily Reconciliation** ➝
15. **Driver Logs Out** ➝
16. **Fleet Maintenance Scheduled** ➝
17. **Driver Training Scheduled**

This event storming exercise helps to clarify the interactions between different systems and actors, ensuring that all components of the cab company’s operations are seamlessly integrated and effectively managed.
